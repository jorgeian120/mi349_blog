      <p>Cats are mysterious little creatures, and somehow even their fur color seems to play a role in how people decide to adopt them, which is wild when you think about it like, are people really out here choosing between life companions based on coat aesthetics as if they’re picking out a throw pillow?</p>
      <p>Apparently, yes, because black cats, despite being sleek, elegant, and basically tiny panthers, still get passed over due to superstitions, and meanwhile, orange cats who are basically goblins wrapped in sunshine fur get scooped up like they’re the golden retrievers of the cat world</p>
      <p>All im saying is that all colors of cats should be given a chance to shine. You never know when taking a chance and adopting a cat might land you a forever furry friend fo the rest of your life.</p>
      <p>Below is a table I made to summarize Cats by their respective color:</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Color</th>
            <th>Adoption Rate</th>
            <th>Overall Satisfaction</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Orange</td>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>Very Destructive, 10/10</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tuxedo</td>
            <td>Medium</td>
            <td>Very Lazy, 10/10</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Grey</td>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>The perfect 10/10 Cat.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Welcome to my cooking blog. My girlfrend and I are currently on a quest to make a dish from every country in the world. Recently, we made a spanish Paella, and it turned out wonderful. We have plans to make Borscht next, as we are both fairly big fans of vegitables</p>
      <p>We have also made Lumpia from the philipines, as well as pasta from Italy and dumplings from China. We are currently looking for more ideas of what to make next, so if you the reader have any ideas, feel free to reach out to me with those ideas and we can try making them next! </p>
      <p>Just subscribe to my newsletter and navigate to the contact me page. and send in those ideas along with what country they would be for!</p>
